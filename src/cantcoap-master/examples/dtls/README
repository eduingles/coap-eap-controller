These examples use libevent2 and tinydtls

http://libevent.org/

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinydtls/

libevent2 is used for efficient handling of incoming UDP packets on client and server.

tinydtls provides basic authentication, encryption, and integrity.

At present I only illustrate the use of a pre-shared key (TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8).
