/*
  A really stupid, brain-dead implementation of EAX mode (hardcoded to use AES
  with 128 bit keys). The idea is that it's easy to verify the code is correct.
  It is not fast. At all. It generates random keys and messages, and dumps
  various things to stdout - the intent of this code is to generate test
  vectors.

  There is a fast EAX implementation in Botan (http://botan.randombit.net)

  Requires OpenSSL 0.9.7 (for the AES support)
